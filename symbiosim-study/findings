+ Reproduce Figure2 from Mahout Paper
    - Looking to observer the TCP buffer size per socket
    - As well as the seq of the first packet in the window

Findings
--------
Linux does not make tcp socket buffer usage available, at least not via /proc.

Netstat provides us with info about active sockets by querying /proc/net/tcp.
Netstat has now been deprecated, note that querying /proc/net/tcp has a
small overhead in addition to not neccesarily being an accurate reflection of
realtime. Introducing ss, which provides similar functionality. However, ss
obtains info about active sockets directly from kernel space using Netlink.
Netlink uses the traditional sockets api. This allows for asychronous
communication with the kernel instead of the synchronus processing associated
with system calls. To gain a better detailed understanding of netlink and its
advantages I highly recommend this article from the LinuxJournal

Command
